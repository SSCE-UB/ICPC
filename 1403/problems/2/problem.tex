\problemWithTime{Contest Preparation Schedule}{1 second}

Birjand University is organizing the 10th ICPC Provincial Competition, and the preparation schedule for this event is critical to its success. The organizing committee needs to create a schedule for multiple preparation activities, ensuring that all necessary tasks are completed on time without any overlap.

Each preparation activity has a specific start time and end time. The goal is to determine if it is possible to schedule all activities such that no two activities overlap.

\subsection*{Input}

The input consists of:
\begin{itemize}
	\item An integer $n$ $(1 \leq n \leq 100)$ representing the number of preparation activities.
	\item $n$ lines, each containing two integers $start$ and $end$ $(0 \leq start < end \leq 1000)$ representing the start time and end time of each activity.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Output}

Output "YES" if it is possible to schedule all activities without any overlap. Otherwise, output "NO".
