\problemWithTime{The Happy Worm}{2 seconds}

The Happy Worm lives in an $m \times n$ rectangular field. There are $k$ stones placed in certain locations of the field. (Each square of the field is either empty, or contains a stone.) Whenever the worm sleeps, it lies either horizontally or vertically, and stretches so that its length increases as much as possible. The worm will not go in a square with a stone or out of the field. The happy worm cannot be shorter than 2 squares.

The question you are to answer is how many different positions this worm could be in while sleeping.

\mysec{Input}

The first line of the input file contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 11$), the number of test cases, followed by the input data for each test case. The first line of each test case contains three integers $m$, $n$, and $k$ ($1 \leq m,n,k \leq 100000$). The input for this test case will be followed by $k$ lines. Each line contains two integers which specify the row and column of a stone. No stone will be given twice.

\mysec{Output}

There should be one line per test case containing the number of positions the happy worm can be in.
